## üìù Getting Started

### Creating a Componentable

To start just select a node and in the inspector click on `Create Componentable`

![Inspector with a Create Componentable Button](images/create_componentable.png)

Then will be create a Component Script for your node, and your node will be ready to have components

In this example, the Component Script created will be `PlayerComponent`, because de class_name of the script in this node is Progress.

> Node don't need to have a script, componentable can be used with build-in types

<br>

### Creating a Component

Just create a Script with a `class_name` and extends `PlayerComponent`, then you can place the behaviour you want inside this component.

in the `PlayerComponent` we have:

```godot
class_name PlayerComponent extends Node

@export var active = true
@export var player: Player
```

so we can access the player using the `player` variable.

<br>

So for in our component example `Glowing` will make the player glow with:

```godot
class_name Glowing extends PlayerComponent

func _ready():
	if active: # active is a variable inside PlayerComponent to make some enabling behaviours
		create_tween().tween_property(player, "modulate:a", 0, 1)
```

then you select the `Componentable` node you can select the component

<br>

> This list of components will show all components that is from this node type and node parent types

when selected a component will show up as a node in components node of your `Componentable`

<br>

![Alt text](images/component_node.png)

Here you can see that we have two variables `player` that will be automatic assign as the `Componentable` Node, and the `active` variable, that will disable the behavior in your logic.

You can make more exported variables to create more customization to your component

<br>

### Getting a Component from a Node

When you want to get a component from a `Componentable`, you can use:

```godot
var glowing: Glowing = Component.find(self, "Glowing")
```

If you want to get a component from a other node, you can use:

```godot
var glowing: Glowing = Component.find(player, "Glowing")
```

> Just remember the component can be null

<br>

### Adding or removing component in runtime

To add a component to a componentable in runtime you can use:

```godot
Component.subscribe(node, "ComponentName")
```

and to remove a component you can use:

```godot
Component.unsubscribe(node, "ComponentName")
```

<br>

### Some others functions

```godot
Component.componentable(node) # will create a Component Script if don't exists to this node, and define this node as a componentable

Component.uncomponentable(node) # will make this node not a Componentable any more

Component.is_componentable(node) # return true if this node is a componentable

Component.has(node, "component") # return true if this componentable have this component

Component.get_all(node) # return all components in this componentable
```
